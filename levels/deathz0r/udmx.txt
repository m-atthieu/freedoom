I told fraggle a few months back I'd finish my UDMX maps and submit
them to freedm: I kept forgetting to do it, so instead I'll upload the
"basic layout" versions of my maps rather than the last UDMX version,
as they're suited for the custom textures/pallete that UDMX used.

The items and player starts are identical to the last versions of the
maps, since I always make layouts first then detail later.

If any of these are useful, I'll finish them off. If not, They'll just
fade into obscurity until I find a different use for them.

For reference, udmx3c is MAP03, udmx4d is MAP01, udmx7b is MAP07.
