Description             : Update does not include any map changes. All
                          skills are implemented.

                          This was a gameplay experiment. All routes
                          are open to choose, but not enough ammo for
                          the gun supplied was given. Need to open
                          another door to resupply ammo but will
                          unleash another small swarm. After you get
                          tired of dying, open up an editor and plan a
                          route, or iddqd to test routes. Know where
                          all items are. Decide what gun you want
                          first and if it is worth waking up the
                          monsters for it.
